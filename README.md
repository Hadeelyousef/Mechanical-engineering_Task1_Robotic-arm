# Mechanical engineering_Task1_Robotic arm

This Repository contains a **3D_RobotArm** file, which shows the final shape of the robotic arm after assembling the pieces together.

In the beginning, the arm was assembled using **Tinkercad website** and all the pieces were placed in the initial state (**90 degrees**)

**Steps for assembling the robotic arm:**
**First:** The base part has been placed at the bottom.

**Second:** The Waist was placed on top of the base.
 
**Third:** Connecting the first arm, or as it is called the lower arm, with the waist.
    
**Fourth:** Connecting the second arm, or as it is called the upper arm, with the first arm.

**Fifth:** The last part was connected to the second arm, which at the end contains the Gripper.
